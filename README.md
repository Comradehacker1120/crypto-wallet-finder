## 🔍 What This Tool Does

This Python script generates random cryptocurrency private keys, derives their public addresses, and checks for balances on various blockchains. When it finds a wallet with a balance, it saves the details and can send Telegram alerts.

⚠️ **Important Note**: This is for educational purposes only. Finding wallets with balances this way is statistically extremely unlikely due to cryptographic security measures.
